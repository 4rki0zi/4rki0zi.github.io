**Russian Sectors Targeted by ExCobalt Cyber Gang with New GoRed Backdoor**

The cybercrime scene is heating up, with news breaking that the notorious ExCobalt gang has been targeting Russian organizations using a previously unknown backdoor known as GoRed. The malicious code, written in Golang, is designed to provide remote access and control over compromised systems.

ExCobalt, a group of hackers focused on cyber espionage, has been active since at least 2016. Interestingly, they are believed to have originated from the notorious Cobalt Gang. The fact that ExCobalt is now using GoRed highlights their continued evolution as malicious actors.

GoRed's capabilities allow it to persist on compromised systems, making it a formidable tool in the hands of attackers. Its ability to establish command and control (C2) connections with its operators enables remote access and control over affected systems. This level of sophistication makes it all the more challenging for security teams to detect and respond to GoRed-related incidents.

The fact that ExCobalt is targeting Russian organizations highlights the gang's focus on cyber espionage, with a particular interest in targeting critical infrastructure. As such, organizations operating in these sectors must be vigilant in detecting and responding to GoRed-based attacks.

In light of this news, it's crucial for security teams to stay informed about emerging threats like GoRed and take proactive measures to strengthen their defenses. With ExCobalt continuing to evolve its tactics, it's more important than ever that organizations prioritize incident response and threat hunting to stay ahead of these malicious actors.
