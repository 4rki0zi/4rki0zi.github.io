**Google's Privacy Sandbox Accused of User Tracking by Austrian Non-Profit**

In a move that raises serious questions about Google's commitment to user privacy, the Austrian non-profit organization noyb (none of your business) has accused Google's Privacy Sandbox feature of being used for user tracking. The controversy centers around Google's plans to deprecate third-party tracking cookies in its Chrome web browser, which was meant to be a step forward in protecting users' online data.

According to noyb, the so-called "Privacy Sandbox" can still be used to track users, rendering it nothing more than a rebranded version of the invasive third-party tracking that it was supposed to replace. This is a major blow to Google's claims about the feature and raises concerns about whether user privacy is truly being protected.

The noyb organization, which is dedicated to protecting user privacy online, has long been critical of Google's track record on this issue. In this latest controversy, they are urging regulators to take action against Google for its continued disregard for user privacy. With this development, it seems that the debate about the effectiveness of Google's Privacy Sandbox is far from over.

As users, we have a right to know what our online data is being used for and by whom. The fact that Google's latest attempt at protecting user privacy has been accused of being nothing more than a ruse is a disturbing development that warrants serious attention. Only time will tell if regulators will take action against Google or if the company will continue to push the boundaries of what it considers acceptable when it comes to user data. One thing is certain, however: users are not going to stand idly by while their privacy is being compromised.
